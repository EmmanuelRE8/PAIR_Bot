PAIR goes beyond a static CV, it demonstrates how Business Intelligence, Data, and AI  
can merge into a single interactive storytelling experience.

- 🔍 Explore **STAR-style** examples that highlight leadership, analytics, and innovation.  
- ⚙️ Experience a **real-world AI application** built with LLMs (Groq), JavaScript, HTML, JSON, and Cloudflare.

### 🧠 Built With
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS (GitHub Pages)
- **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers + Groq API (Llama 3.1)
- **Knowledge Base:** JSON sources (`profile.json`, `kb.json`, `star_bank.json`)
